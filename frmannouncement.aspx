                                    the strongest and the greatest tool of sharing information, changing in the 
                                    process, the arithmetic of economics, contours of cultural landscape and 
                                    intricate patterns of social fabric. For those who are wary and skeptical of its

                        <span>fact that everybody is going online, so we might do that as well. With the 
                        advent of internet or online journalism, time has come full circle with one 
                        skilled person now potent enough to do all kinds of job of writing, editing, 
                        printing and marketing with unexpected ease on that. It has redefined and 
                        respelled the whole world of mass communications, and continues to do so with 
                        added vigour, transforming the concept globalization into glocalization - 
                        localization of global and globalization of local news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                        <span>It will be fair to say that online journalism caters more to the newly 
                        emerging genre of “active users” than “passive consumers” of information. It is 
                        also tantamount to the end of the ever-persisting cold war between the media 
                        gatekeepers and the PR managers over the as-yet-unadulterated devilish 
                        catchphrase of “space constraint”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                        <span>I regard the starting of the Online Punjabi University News Bulletin by 
                        the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication as a seminal venture in its 
                        futuristic development. It will immensely help its students to stay tuned to one 
                        of the latest trends in mass communication. I strongly appeal to the University 
                        fraternity to use it as a mainstream newsmedia for a developmental projection of 
                        the University affairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
